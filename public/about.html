<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/COVERPHOTO.jpg"height=200 alt="photo of ian Lutaaya"/><p>I am fortunate enough to have been around long enough to witness 30 summers; the first 15 of these having been spent in a tropical part of the world(East Africa)
  and the last 15 in various places in Europe and North America. I am relatively well travelled thanks to my job in His Majesty's service but also to my wonderful wife's love for travel.
  When not travelling I am working to pay for the travelling and when not doign learnig to code. Welcome to my web development Journey
